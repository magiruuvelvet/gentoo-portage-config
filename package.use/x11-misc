# change "primerun" into a stub, to make sure programs launched with it are running on the dGPU
# my system allows me to swap the 2 GPUs to make the dGPU the default and the iGPU the secondary offloading GPU
# due to hardware wiring reasons with the HDMI port, I made the dGPU the default to workaround DRM corruption bugs in Wayland
# the entire displaying on all monitors is now handled by only the dGPU which fixes some obscure amdgpu driver crashes
#  + this also fixes the systemd-boot menu being invisible when an external monitor is connected
#    (most likely a firmware bug causing the 2 GPUs fighting over the internal screen)
# the system was not designed to be operated in hybrid graphics mode and is only offered for tinkerers
