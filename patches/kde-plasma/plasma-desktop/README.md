# `revert-829501dd777966091ddcf94e5c5247aaa78ac832.patch`

Reverts the "fix" for mouse pointer acceleration
which changed the behavior and bricked my mouse
acceleration. Everything is totally fucked with
this commit so revert it.

# `pager-always-show-minimized-windows.patch`

Visualizes even minimized windows in the Plasma Pager to
see what the fuck is going on on my 10 workspaces with
a KWin Tiling WM Script. Makes live so much easier, never
lose minimized windows again in this workspace mess.
