# note:
# x11-libs/libxkbcommon seems to be affected too, but works without noticeable issues
# software compiled by myself has no problems loading libxkbcommon.so
# the only annoyance is precompiled and closed-source software which emit this warning
# /usr/lib64/libxkbcommon.so.0: no version information available (required by /path/to/elf)
# but seem to work anyway and X11 keyboard related stuff works
