# prebuilt and proprietary packages depending on GNU runtime libraries
# those packages are either patched using patchelf or contain a custom
# or modified launcher script exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# all patching is done using portage-hook-ctrl to only affect my system
#
# patchelf is cleaner but not always possible (discord for example)
# patchelf is mandatory on SUID binaries (like vmware-vmx)
# launcher scripts are required for crap like vscodium to make native plugins happy
